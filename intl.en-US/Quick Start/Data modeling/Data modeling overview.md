1.  Add a data source: You must use data sources as the basis to operate datasets, worksheets, and dashboards, data portals, and others. For details about how to operate a data source, see [Data sources management overview](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Data source management/Data sources management overview.md#).
2.  Select a table in a data source to create a dataset: You can create a dataset-based data chart. For details about how to operate a dataset, see [Datasets management overview](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Dataset management/Datasets management overview.md#).
3.  \(Optional\) Upload a CSV file to create a dataset: You can use a locally uploaded CSV file to create a dataset. This function is only available for personal workspace. For details about how to operate a CSV file, see [Upload local files](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Data source management/Upload local files.md#).
4.  \(Optional\) Use a custom SQL statement to create a dataset: You can use a custom SQL statement on MaxCompute to create a dataset. For details about how to operate a custom SQL statement, see [SQL overview](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/27860.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.a3.4.64c91d9a38fP3C).
