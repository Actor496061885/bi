    -   To delete a field from the data element area, click **Delete** behind the field.
    -   To sort the values of a field in ascending or descending order in the chart, click the up or down arrow behind the field.
3.  Drag a dimension field to the Color Legend area.

    The values of this field are marked by different colors in the chart.Â  If a dimension field cannot be dragged to the Color Legend area, the system reports an error message. Add or delete dimension or measurement fields according to the error message.

    The following procedure uses the **Product\_Type** field as an example.

    1.  Drag the **Product** Type field from the dimension list to the **Color Legend** area and click **Update**.

        You can set **Coefficient** to change the conversion unit of the original value. The Coefficient parameter supports only multiplication.

        For example, if the unit of the original value is centimeter and you want the value to be expressed in units of meters, you must divide the original value by 100. To achieve this, enter 0.01 in the Coefficient text box. Reversely, if the unit of the original value is meter and you want the value to be expressed in units of centimeters, enter 100 in the Coefficient text box.

    -   Settings: For a dimension or measure field, set the display style of the field in the chart, including chart type, colors, labels, and decimals.
