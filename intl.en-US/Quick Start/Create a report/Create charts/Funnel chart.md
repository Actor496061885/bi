If you have read [Dashboard overview](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Dashboard overview.md#) and [Dashboard basic operations](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Dashboard basic operations/Dashboard basic operations.md#), read this section to learn about how to create a funnel chart. If you need to edit the dataset or create a new dataset, see [Create a dataset](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Dataset management/Create a dataset.md#).

The funnel chart can be used to analyze business procedure that is relatively standard and has a long cycle and many phases. By comparing business data at each phase using a funnel chart, you can intuitively locate the problem and find the cause. The funnel chart can also be used to show the conversion rate between each phase. It can apply to analysis of complex business procedures. For example, a funnel chart can intuitively show the rate of visitors that finally buy any product after accessing the website.

A funnel chart consists of funnel layer labels and the funnel layer width. A funnel layer label is determined by the data dimension, such as the region. A funnel layer width is determined by the data measurement, such as the order amount.
