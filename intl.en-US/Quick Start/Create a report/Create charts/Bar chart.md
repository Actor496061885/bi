# Bar chart {#concept_bnq_fd2_vdb .concept}

If you have read [Dashboard overview](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Dashboard overview.md#) and [Dashboard basic operations](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Dashboard basic operations/Dashboard basic operations.md#), read this section to learn about how to create a bar chart.Â  If you need to recreate a data set, see [Create a dataset](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Data modeling/Dataset management/Create a dataset.md#).

For its clear demonstration of the differences among multiple groups of data, a bar chart can be used to show data variations in a specific period of time or to compare different items, for example, to compare the traffic flows of a road crossing during different periods.

The bar chart and [Line chart](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Create a report/Create charts/Line chart.md#) have similar components. They both include a category axis and a value axis.

## Notice on creating a bar chart {#section_pxd_3d2_vdb .section}

Set at least one dimension for the category axis of a bar chart, such as a province or a product type. Set at least one measurement for the value axis, such as the order quantity or profit amount. Color legends only support dimension fields, and a maximum of one dimension can be set for each color legend.

**Note:** The color legend can be used when only one measurement field is set for the value axis. Otherwise, this feature is unavailable.

The following uses the company\_sales\_record dataset as an example.

**Scenario: Compare the transportation costs of different products in provinces of China East.**

1.  Log on to Quick BI console.
2.  Click **Datasets**. The dataset management page is displayed.
3.  Select company\_sales\_record dataset, and click **Create Dashboard**.
4.  Double-click **Bar chart** icon.
5.  In the dimension list, select **area** field, and add it to the filter.

    We need to use the filter to select China East from the region list, as shown in the following figure.

7.  Select East and click **OK**.
8.  In the dimension list, locate the **province** and **product\_type** options, and add them to the category axis area in sequence.

    **Note:** Make sure that the dimension type of the province field has been changed from string to geographical information.

9.  In the measurement list, locate the **shipping\_cost** option, and add it to the value axis area.
10. You can add the **product\_type** field to the color legend.

    **Note:** The color legend can be used when only one measurement field is set for the value axis. Otherwise, this feature is unavailable.

11. Click **Update**. The system automatically updates the chart.
12. On the Style tab, you can edit the title, layout, and legends of the chart.
13. Click **Save** to save current dashboard.

To delete the current chart, point to the upper-right corner of the chart, and choose **Delete** from the shortcut menu.
