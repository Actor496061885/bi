# How to make chart join {#concept_jrd_kfz_5db .concept}

You can create a dashboard with multiple charts join by using the following steps.

Users often have the following requirements when preparing dashboards. When a region of a chart control in a dashboard is selected, the content of other chart controls related to the chart control in the dashboard is linked with the content of members of the dimension corresponding to the selected region.

The following uses a sample dataset provided in the data modeling as an example to describe how to prepare a dashboard associated with multiple charts.

The dashboard consists of two chart controls. A pie chart is located at the top, showing the profit data of the region. A table is located at the bottom, showing the sales and profit data of cities in the region.
